  <h1>NRL Salary Cap</h1>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's premier rugby league competition. The league in its various forms has been running since 1908.  In 1990, the league introduced a salary cap in an attempt to level the playing field between participating clubs. There is <em>some</em> evidence to suggest this worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fan, the only thing that matters is winning, and winning often. Seasons in which our team doesn't win are just agonising space between the good times. So how long do we have to wait between wins? In the chart below, for the 25 years before and after the salary cap introduction, we show just that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black series shows how long the minor premier for that year had to wait since their last win.  If they haven't won before, the value will be the number of seasons since they entered the competition. Hovering over a point will show which team was victorious that year. This is a considerably volatile series for the entire period, but post 1990 it has settled somewhat. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But what about your team? By clicking on the individual teams in the legend, you can toggle on and off series specific to each. These series show the number of years the team has gone without winning. A value of zero means, they won that year. If we consider this measure across all teams for that year, we can arrive at an average. This mean is shown in the solid red line.
    </p>
    <p>
      This line appears to be on a downward trend for much of the past 50 years, but in the last 10 years is steadily increasing. Is this a sign the salary cap has worked, or is it simply a result of the ever increasing professionalism of the sport?
    </p>
    <p>
      The two dashed red lines compare the mean of the means before and after 1990. These values are 16.22 and 12.49 years respectively and again suggest that there is a tightening of the competition between the two periods.
