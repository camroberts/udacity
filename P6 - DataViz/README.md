# NRL Salary Cap

## Summary
The National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia's premier rugby league football competition. The league in its various forms has been running since 1908. In 1990, the league introduced a salary cap in an attempt to level the playing field between participating clubs. I've set out to see if the cap made the competition more even by investigating the end of regular season standings of participating teams over the past fifty years. Primarily, I'm interested in how many seasons pass between minor premiership wins (ie. finishing first in the table) and how long the fans are waiting for their team to win.  After all, this is the often the most important thing to a fan - winning.

I've used the minor premiership rather than the champion or grand final winner since I feel that a team which leads over twenty or thirty rounds and loses the final is still the best performing team of that season. However, many would argue fans care more about the grand final winner. So, this analysis could be performed again using that as the benchmark instead.

There is more information about how to interpret the final visualisation included in the webpage itself.

## Design
I really wanted to involve the viewer in the chart, to allow them to discover their own insights.  My two main ideas for the chart were:

1. A chart which shows the number of unique winners of the minor premiership in the last n years. The viewer would be able to choose n.
2. A chart which shows the number of years each team has been waiting to win the minor premiership. The viewer would be able to choose different teams.

Ultimately, I selected the second option as I felt this was more engaging. Especially if the viewer is a rugby league fan and is able to choose their own team.  As well as hopefully illustrating if the salary cap did or did not have a levelling effect, the chart also provides a neat way of showing the history of the competition.

I chose to implement the chart in Dimple.js rather than D3.js as I thought being a relatively straight forward line chart, it would be smoother experience.  However, even with this chart, I feel I reached the limit of what could be done with Dimple.js and I regretted my choice in the end.  The availability of features somewhat determined the final design, more of which I'll discuss in the feedback section.

The interactivity of the chart is provided through the legend. I found examples of Dimple.js charts using the legend as buttons. While the end product works, I'm not 100% happy with the method. Without explaining it to the reader, it's not obvious the legend behaves like this, and it's clumsy to implement.

Data preparation was done in R. The raw data set was originally the ladder positions of each team for each season. Calculating the time between minor premierships was programmed.

The data is a timeseries, so it was logical that it should be a line chart. However, due to the number of teams which have competed over the league's history, the way in which to lead the discovery of the message was one that required thought. I originally tried to show all teams and the mean series in one chart thinking that the carefull use of colour would allow the viewer to digest the chart effectively. I would make only the mean and selected teams coloured and all other lines a light grey. In this way you would still be able to make some comparisons between the lines in the forefront and background. Also, you might see an interesting grey line you wish to investigate.  However, this presentation was not working.  The chart was still too busy, and I was not able to bring the selected teams to the front of the chart. ie. The selection mechanism was suffering because coloured lines could still be obscured by grey ones.

Another important aspect of the chart was being able to show the current season winner. There were a few suggestions on how to accomplish this including adding it to the x-axis labels. In the end, I found it was effective to add this to the tooltip of the 'Winner' line. This line is always present in the chart and literally depicts the winning team over time.

I left the default Dimple.js gridlines. These help with comparison, and thoughtfully by default are a muted colour which does not clutter the chart.

The legend is a hefty one. While it does perform the task of labelling the mean and winner lines, perhaps the team selection would have been better as drop down menu. But as I previously mentioned I found an example of a Dimple.js charting using this method of selection.  I also stuck with the Dimple.js default colour scheme, but am not completely happy with this. Time permitting I would have explored other palettes and maybe even attempted to define one using actual team colours.

Due to its size, the legend was positioned in a horizontal layout rather than vertical. Placing it above or below the chart would have worked. I chose the top so that the viewer immediately saw it (even before the chart) and was prompted to engage with it.

The webpage design is simple. Description first, chart second. I wanted to ensure the viewer read the introduction first to understand the idea and spark their interest. While it's not been guaranteed for all screen sizes, I was happy with the way the chart is not revealed until scrolling down after the introduction (at least on my laptop).

## Feedback
### Round 1
The visualisation provided in folder v0.1 was the first attempt at the chart and was quite a rough sketch. I provided the chart to my father.

#### Feedback
* When I clicked on the legend I was unable to get back to the original graph.
* Perhaps "Premier" and "Mean" get lost in the legend.
* Some Teams/colors are very hard to see.
* So, if the salary cap was effective how would that be revealed on the graph?
* The graphic, on first impressions, seems to be very busy with lots of lines.
* The time period is maybe too long. Perhaps just look at 25yrs before and after the salary cap introduction.
* Would it be clearer if you named the vertical axis "No. of years since winning Minor Premiership"?

#### Response
As a result of dad's feedback I made the following major changes:
* Restricted the data set to 1965 - 2015.
* Made the background team lines lighter grey.
* Made the premier and mean lines stand out in bolder black colour.
* Improved the explanation in the introduction.
* I did not change the y axis label as it means slightly different things for the different series. No. years or seasons is a constant.
* Allowed the ability to toggle teams.

### Round 2
The visualisation provided in folder v0.2 was the second attempt and was sent to my mother for feedback.

#### Feedback
* Can you change the labels on the horizontal axis to say the year & the minor premier for that year?
* I am not sure the data is represented correctly. For example, in 1998 it shows Brisbane 0 years.  We interpret this to mean they won the premiership in 1998.
But in 2000 Team Brisbane 0 years. But it would in fact be 2 years since they won it if they won it in 1998.
In 2001 it says New Zealand 1. If that is the case wouldn't that mean they won it in 2000?  But Brisbane did.
* I had a look at Cronulla. 1998 shows 1 year since winning, but 1997 was not won by Cronulla.
* Not sure what "All" is.

#### Response
After my mum's feedback I made the following changes:
* Gave up on "greying out" the unselected teams since I could not achieve the polish with Dimple I required. Instead I changed to filtering the data so that only selected lines are shown.
* Replaced the All button with Show All and Reset.
* Investigated some of the data issues. I discovered the problem leading to misinterpreted results was that in the late nineties there was a lot of upheaval in the competition. In fact a rival league ran for a single season and around half the teams defected to that competition before returning the following. As a side effect, the count of the number of years since winning or entering the competition was reset. I overcame this issue, by treating this gap year as a continuation in which the non-competing teams did not win.
* Customised the tool tips for the "Winner" series to show the name of the winning team for that year.
* Updated the descriptive text and axes labels.

### Round 3
Folder v0.3 contains the third version for which I sought feedback. This time, my wife was the victim.

#### Feedback
* Why does the mean and winner lines move when clicking them?
* Need to highlight before and after salary cap more.
* What happens when teams merge?

#### Response
* The buttons for mean and winner were not working correctly, they should have no action, as I want them to remain in the chart.
* There were two mergers of teams into new clubs in 1999 and 2000. The new team started with a count of zero while I believe they should in some sense inherit the history of the merging clubs. So I continued the count of the years elapsed by taking the average of the two merging teams.
* To more adequately address the relationship of the data with the salary cap which has been an ongoing theme in the feedback, I added some extra mean lines to show the difference between eras. (Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to remove these extra unnecessary boxes from the legend. Or at least have them separate in some way.)
